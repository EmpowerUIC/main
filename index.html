                        <p> Mohammed is a 2nd-year student majoring in Biology and minoring in Political Science. He has served in various roles in UIC’s Student Government and its current Treasurer. Mohammed’s motivation to serve and connect with the UIC community stems from his background as a Muslim immigrant and the mentality of “paying it forward,” whether it’s advocating for critical issues such as college affordability, mental health resources, or competitive wages. Besides his involvement with USG, Mohammed is also involved with various prominent student organizations on campus and is an ex-officio member of the UIC Senate. He hopes to bring a culture of empowering the average student to the highest levels of representation by advocating on the Board of Trustees.</p>

He started out as Interim Speaker of the House, and in the Spring 2021 semester, became Chief of Staff. Currently, he serves as the Director of Student Success where he has worked to improve career resources, advocated for improved course programs, and implemented two textbook affordability programs. Initially, USG was supposed to be a side hobby for Matthew to observe the inner workings of UIC, but he soon realized that community service and public policy was his passion, and loved his work at USG. As President, Matthew will continue to strive to uplift student voices, cultivate UIC’s communities, and empower futures.  
                            Outside of USG, Matthew is the President of the Illinois PIRG UIC Chapter, Treasurer of the Chess Club at UIC, and the Vice President of the Chicago Chess Center. 
                            Ourside of school Matthew enjoys basketball, chess, and cooking. He proudly owns two pet turtles and is a long term investor of Dogecoin</p>

                        <p>  Michael is a second year political science major interested in the intersection of policy within healthcare. He’s passionate about current events and discovering new things. Outside of school, Mike love exploring Chicago and trying new good foods from other cultures.

                <h3>Our Communities</h3>
                <p class="lead">This year as we returned to campus and the pandemic began to fade, we have worked to reignite our campus community. This year through events such as the UIC Tailgate and Connecting Student Leaders, we've made major strides. We will continue this work by empowering clubs through funding, continuing to bring Greek life together, and advocating for programs that student demand. Safety has been a corner stone of the work we have conducted from the creation of the Safety Task Force to advocating for and establishing improved safety on West Campus.</p>
                   <br>
                   <p style="margin-left: 40px">- Put student safety first and continue to advocate to impliment student-backed recommendations</p>
                   <p style="margin-left: 40px">- Improve student housing and empower student workers. </p>
                   <p style="margin-left: 40px">- Elevate our campus experience.</p>
                   <p style="margin-left: 40px">- Advocate for a fair contract for our graduate student workers. </p>

                <h3>Our Futures</h3>
                <p class="lead">The cost of education is one of the largest burdens on our generation. The Empower candidates have spent the past year dedicating over $3,000 investing in Open Education Resources (OER). We plan to continue this work if elected by increasing this investment and continuing to invest in and advocate for lower textbook costs. With a seat on both the USG and Board of Trustees, we will fight to keep fees and tuition low. Preventing increases that continue to raise costs in the future.</p>
                   <br>
                   <p style="margin-left: 40px">- Ensure students are competitive in the job market through promoting career development resources. Over the past year we have hosted networking events and career workshops to help empower student professionally. We will continue this work and leverage UIC's connections to Chicago's business community.</p>
                   <p style="margin-left: 40px">- Increase access to scholarship resources and advocate for increased investment.</p>
