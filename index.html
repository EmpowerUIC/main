                        <h4>President</h4>
                        <h2>Matthew</h2>
                        <p> Matthew Almendras is a 3rd-year public health major with a concentration in health policy and is on the pre-law track. As the current serving President of the Undergraduate Student Government (USG), Matthew has led many initiatives that improved our UIC campus and the student experience.  He started out as Interim Speaker of the House, and in the Spring 2021 semester, became Chief of Staff. He then served as the Director of Student Success where he has worked to improve career resources, advocated for improved course programs, and implemented two textbook affordability programs. Initially, USG was supposed to be a side hobby for Matthew to observe the inner workings of UIC, but he soon realized that community service and public policy was his passion, and loved his work at USG.Next year, Matthew seeks to continue his work in textbook affordability, helping food insecure students, and expanding and promoting opportunities for students to be successful. Outside of USG, Matthew is the Treasurer of the Chess Club at UIC, and a Director at the Chicago Chess Center. He currently is a Government and Community Relations Intern for the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA). For fun Matthew loves playing chess and basketball, as well as keeping up with current events.

                        <h4>Vice President</h4>
                        <h2>Michael</h2>
                        <p>  Michael Fernandes is a 3rd year GPPA Medical Scholars student majoring in Political Science and minoring in public policy. As the current Vice President, Michael Fernandes worked hard to expand inclusivity on campus through expanding religious exemptions and better practices on campus. In addition, he advocated for a full-week Fall break to the point where the Senate Executive Committee at UIC is considering implementing this for Fall 2024. Michael Fernandes also passed a resolution that reenacts the Library Shuttle for UIC students to use starting at 9pm. Michael will continue to look into ways to improve student safety on campus and to facilitate the success of students. Michael Fernandes wants to add 24/7 mental health counseling to campus, finish his work on expanding Fall break to a week, and support President Matthew Almendras to implement the Meal Swipe Donation Program. With your support, Michael will help ensure our student population is healthy and prepared for personal and academic success.  </p>

                <p class="lead">This year as we returned to campus and the pandemic began to fade, we have worked to reignite our campus community. This year through events such as the UIC Tailgate and Connecting Student Leaders, we've made major strides. We will continue this work by empowering clubs through funding, continuing to bring Greek life together, and advocating for programs that student demand. Safety has been a corner stone of the work we have conducted from the creation of the Safety Task Force to advocating for and establishing improved safety on West Campus.</p>

                <p class="lead">The cost of education is one of the largest burdens on our generation. The Empower candidates have spent the past year dedicating over $3,000 investing in Open Education Resources (OER). We plan to continue this work if elected by increasing this investment and continuing to invest in and advocate for lower textbook costs. With a seat on both the USG and Board of Trustees, we will fight to keep fees and tuition low. We will work to preventing increases that continue to raise costs in the future.</p>

We will continue this work and leverage UIC's connections to Chicago's business community.</p>
